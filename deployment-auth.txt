Building: (!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
Building: - Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
Building: - Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
Building: - Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.
